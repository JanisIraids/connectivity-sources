# The source code for "Representing polynomial of ST-Connectivity"
This repository contains the source code accompanying the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15018.

ub.cpp contains the code constructing the matrices needed for the upper bound. Similarly, lb.cpp contains the code constructing the matrices needed for the lower bound. Both use the power iteration method defined in util.hpp to compute the maximum eigenvalue.

## The upper bound

## The lower bound
